"""
A high-level API for digital filters:

Features include:
    - Automatic detection of numerical instability
    - Single-line filter generation and application
    - Supports lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop filter types
    - Supports any filter characteristic available in scipy
    - Lets you enter the corner frequencies as Hz,
    - Direct frequency response generation
    - Filters implent __call__ for direct filtfilt application
    - ChainedFilter to deal with complex characteristics or unstable high-order filters
    - SumFilter that add the components of multiple individual filters to easily combine multiple
      bandpass filters
    - SumFilter and ChainedFilter are arbitrarily combinable
    - Intuitive, readable error messages for non-mathematicians
