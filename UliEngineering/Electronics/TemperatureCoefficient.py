    """
    Given a component with a nominal value (nominal) at a reference temperature (tref)
    and a fixed coefficient of temperature (coefficient, e.g. "100 ppm"),
    computes the actual value of the component at temperature.

    The coefficient of temperature is interpreted in accordance with MIL-STD-202G.
    
    Keyword arguments
    -----------------
    nominal : number or string
        The nominal value of the component e.g. 1023 or "1.023 kΩ"
    coefficient : number or string
        The temperature coefficient of the component per °C
        e.g. "100 ppm", "1 %" or 100e-6
        Note that positive values cause larger values at higher temperatures
        while negative values cause larger values at lower temperatures!
    temperature : number or string
        The temperature to compute the value of the component at
        e.g. "-40 °C". or -40 or "100 K"
        Numbers are interpreted as °C, strings are automatically converted.
    tref : number or string
        The temperature at which the nominal value was measured, i.e. the "reference temperature".
        MIL-STD-202G specifies this as 25°C.
        If not specified in the component datasheet, this is usually "20 °C" or "25 °C".
        Numbers are interpreted as °C, strings are automatically converted.

    Returns
    -------
    A unit-less value representing the value of the component at the given temperature

def value_range_over_temperature(nominal, coefficient="100ppm", tolerance="0 %", tmin="-40 °C", tmax="85 °C", tref="25 °C", significant_digits=4):
    """
    Given a component which has a nominal value (e.g. "1 kΩ")
    at tref (typically "25 °C") and a coefficient of temperature (e.g. "100ppm").

    Computes the mininimum and maximum possible value of that component
    over the entire temperature range.

    Optionally, a component tolerance can be given (defaults to "0 %")
    to also account for static (temperature-independent) differences.
    Note that the tolerance is applied to the nominal value before
    applying the temperature coefficient.

    The min/max values are computed in accordance with MIL-STD-202 method 304.
    
    The coefficient and static tolerance can be given as number or as string
    e.g. as ppm, ppb or %
    and is interpreted as "plus-minus" value.
    Alternatively, it can be given as a 2-tuple indicating separate "+"
    and "-" values (e.g. ("-30 ppm", "100 ppm")).
    Note that the negative value has to be negative if there is a
    negative temperature coefficient!

    -----------------
    nominal : number or string
        The nominal value of the component e.g. 1023 or "1.023 kΩ"
    coefficient : number or string or 2-tuple (see above)
        The temperature coefficient of the component per °C
        e.g. "100 ppm", "1 %" or 100e-6
        or: ("-30 ppm", "100 ppm") (separate + and - values)
    tolerance : number or string or 2-tuple (see above)
        The static (temperature-independent) tolerance of the component.
        e.g. "100 ppm", "1 %" or 100e-6
        or: ("-0.5 %", "1.0%") (separate + and - values)
    tmin : number or string
        The minimum temperature to consider in °C, e.g. "-40 °C". or -40 or "100 K"
        Numbers are interpreted as °C, strings are automatically converted.
    tmax : number or string
        The maximum temperature to consider in °C, e.g. "85 °C". or 85 or "300 K".
        Numbers are interpreted as °C, strings are automatically converted.
    tref : number or string
        The temperature at which the nominal value was measured, i.e. the "reference temperature".

    significant_digits : integer
        How many significant digits to show in the resulting value strings
