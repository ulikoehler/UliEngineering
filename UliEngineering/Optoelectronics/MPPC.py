    Estimate a MPPC's individual pixel's capacitance from the terminal capacitance.
    
    Typically, this overestimates the capacitance because the case & trace capacitance is included
    in the terminal capacitance. The overestimation effect is particularly large for MPPCs with very small
    pixels such as 15Î¼m.
