A Python3 library for:
    - Data science
    - Electronics Engineering
    - Specialized algorithms
    - Physics
which contains a collection of functions I haven't found elsewhere.
Some algorithms have also been accepted on my blog [https://techoverflow.net/](https://techoverflow.net/)

Pull requests and bugreports of any kind are happily accepted.

## Installation

Run this command on your favourite shell:

```sh
sudo pip3 install UliEngineering
```

In order to install the latest bleeding-edge version, use:

```sh
sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/ulikoehler/UliEngineering.git
```

We *highly recommend* you also install scipy:
```sh
sudo pip3 install scipy
```
(you can also use `sudo apt install python3-scipy` on Debian-based Linux distros).

While *scipy* is technically optional and listed as an optional dependency, many UliEngineering modules can't be used without it, including (might not be complete!):

  * UliEngineering.Length
  * UliEngineering.SignalProcessing.Interpolation
  * UliEngineering.SignalProcessing.Correlation
  * UliEngineering.Physics.JohnsonNyquistNoise
  * Some functions in UliEngineering.SignalProcessing.Simulation
  * Some functions in UliEngineering.SignalProcessing.Selection

After that you can use UliEngineering from any Python3 instance. Example:

```
$ python3
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from UliEngineering.EngineerIO import *
>>> format_value(0.015, "V")
'15.0 mV'
```

## Testing

In order to run the unit tests, first install tox:

```sh
pip install --user tox
```

and then just run it in the root directory of the cloned repository

```sh
tox
```
